Author: Peter Kim and Zachary Schumpert

Version: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are creating a basic full stack application for a book list which will render books from a PostgresSQL database.  Today we're focusing on the part of the applicatoin that involves storing book objects in a database.  The client can make a request to the server for retrieval of all books, which will then be rendered as a list in the browser. 

## Getting Started
To build this app, the user must install node.js, express, postgres, cors, heroku, create a heroku account and setup a heroku server and create their own github repository to house the project.  The user must also have an understanding and utilize jQuery, AJAX, JSON and Handlebars.  

## Architecture
The application is designed using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and JSON.    Also, install node.js, and the express, postres and cors modules.  Also, install heroku and setup a server.  Handlebars will also be used to create the application.
